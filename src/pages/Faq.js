                <br />
                A. This is a video game. I hope this answers your question. Please refrain from asking such questions. You look like a fool (joke).

                <br />

                <br />
                A. Both the youtube and twitter are equally the best ways. Therefore I mention them both. Also, join the mailing list on the contact page.

                <br />
                A. The website is a wip, a lot of the art is placeholder, most pages are incomplete. And despite the fact that three people are listed on the about us page, there is actually only one person working on this. This is a lot of work and things will be done when I get around to them.
