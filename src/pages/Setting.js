                Welcome to New Yinneva City, where the people are tired, the devils are in excess, and the Gods are quite dead. Thankfully,
                some angels still exist and make genuine attempts at preserving the human race. That got dark. I shall go again.

                Welcome to New Yinneva City, a place so wonderful, the planet was named after it. Or maybe it was the other way round? Remember when it was called
                earth? Oh well, God bless Yinneva.

                the flashy and expensive city of dreams. Every ambitious young adult wishes they
                lived here because it is objectively the only way they can ever find their dreams come true. No crisis ever could
                make anyone want to leave this place.
